# Vue_Node_Codes
This is the first version of the exercise about components, of the nice course of Udemy.com, about Vue 2.0.
It is a simple SPA page with three components in the page,i say : "Header","Body" and "Footer".
It is a very basic APP, really a "Practice Exercise" about the use of Vue components.
I create a component for the Header section of the page because I suppose that will repeat in another pages,
in the future. I considered a "lay-out" repeating itself in a few pages.
The second page contains a dinamic list of html paragraphs, with a basic information of "status of servers".
Just a simple information, for the example of the "v-for" directive of VueJs.
And the third component, associated with the "footer" of the page. But this "footer" is not about "authors" or
enterprise informations. In this exercise, would be the section where the servers would be "activated" or "desactived",
for example.
If anybody manifest interest, I can explain with more details in a near future.
